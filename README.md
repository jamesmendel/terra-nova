### Features
- **Improvised Trails, Powered by AI**: Every journey begins with a prompt. TERRA’s sophisticated AI translates your intentions, available time, and precise location into a tailored trail of GPS coordinates. Users don't know where TERRA will take them; the only certainty is finding their way back to the starting point.
- **Wander Without Your Phone**: TERRA invites users to leave their smartphones behind and reconnect with their surroundings. The standalone device boasts a minimalist interface, featuring a tranquil compass needle and gentle haptic feedback to ensure users remain engaged with the present moment.  
- **Open-Source by Design**: TERRA is designed with a DIY mindset. Anyone can download the open-source software, 3D print the CAD designs, assemble the necessary hardware, and start wandering.

### Software

The TERRA App generates coordinates or checkpoints from a starting point and an ideal trail length using the ChatGPT API.

### Running TERRA App Locally

#### Prerequisites 
- `Node.js` v21.5
- `body-parser` v1.20.2
- `cors` v2.8.5
- `express` v4.19.0
- `node-fetch` v3.3.2

To run the TERRA App locally, follow these steps:

1. **Implement ChatGPT API Key:** Obtain a [ChatGPT API key](https://platform.openai.com/) and replace ```YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY``` with it in the ```server.js``` file.
2. **Implement Google Maps API Key:** Obtain a [Google Places API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview) and replace ```YOUR_MAPS_KEY``` with it in the ```index.js``` file.
3. **Run Locally:** To run the application, use the command:
    ```
    node server.js
    ```
4. **Load Application:** Open `index.html` in a browser to use the app for generating a route.
5. **Download config.h File:** Download the `config.h` file which contains the generated route configuration.
6. **Update Arduino Code:** Replace the `config.h` file in the Arduino code directory with the newly downloaded file.

## Arduino Code

To run the Arduino code, you will need to set up the ESP32 board and install the necessary libraries.

### Setup Steps

1. **ESP32 Arduino Setup:** Add the ESP32 board to the Arduino IDE.
    - Go to **Arduino > Preferences**.
    - Add the following URL to the **Additional Boards Manager URLs**:
      ```
      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_dev_index.json
      ```
    - Select **Adafruit Feather ESP32 V2** as the board.

2. **Install Libraries:** Install the following libraries through the Library Manager in the Arduino IDE.
    - `TinyGPSPlus.h`
    - `TFT_eSPI.h`
    - `Adafruit_DRV2605.h`

3. **Upload the Code:** After installing the libraries and updating the `config.h` file with new coordinates, upload the code to the ESP32 device. The device should work without further adjustments.

4. **Debug Mode:** A `debugMode` flag is available in the code. To test the device with manual coordinates, set this flag to `true` and input coordinates into the serial monitor.

### Further Customizations

You can use your own checkpoint files by converting black and white images into a compatible format.

#### Using Your Own Checkpoint Files

- Convert static black and white, 240x240PX `.bmp` images to `.XBM` format using [this online tool](https://www.online-utility.org/image/convert/to/XBM).
- Open the XBM file in a text editor and copy the hexadecimal values included in the curly brackets.
- Replace the existing files in the `images/checkpoints` directory with your customized `.h` file.
